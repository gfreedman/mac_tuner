"""Homebrew package manager health and maintenance checks.

This module audits the state of the Homebrew package manager across five
dimensions:

1. **Installation health** (``HomebrewDoctorCheck``) — Runs ``brew doctor``
   to detect broken symlinks, PATH conflicts, stale git state, and other
   issues that cause silent failures in package management.

2. **Outdated formulae** (``HomebrewOutdatedCheck``) — Identifies CLI tools
   and libraries with available updates. Stale packages may carry unpatched
   CVEs.

3. **Outdated casks** (``HomebrewOutdatedCasksCheck``) — Same concern for
   GUI applications managed as Homebrew casks (e.g. browsers, editors).

4. **Orphaned dependencies** (``HomebrewAutoremoveCheck``) — Packages
   installed as transitive dependencies that are no longer required by
   anything. Safe to remove; accumulate as disk waste over time.

5. **Cache cleanup** (``HomebrewCleanupCheck``) — Old package downloads in
   Homebrew's cache that are no longer needed. Can reach several gigabytes
   on active developer machines.

6. **Missing dependencies** (``HomebrewMissingCheck``) — Formulae whose
   declared dependencies are not installed, causing runtime failures that
   can be difficult to diagnose.

Design decisions:
    - All checks inherit from ``_HomebrewBase``, which sets ``requires_tool =
      "brew"``. The base class runner skips the check with a friendly message
      rather than erroring if ``brew`` is not on ``$PATH``.
    - MacPorts is detected by the base framework but no MacPorts-specific
      checks are implemented; the comment in ``_BREW_MISSING_MSG`` documents
      this deliberately limited scope.
    - Dry-run flags (``--dry-run``) are used wherever available to avoid
      side effects during an audit pass.
    - The ``import re`` inside ``HomebrewCleanupCheck.run`` is intentional:
      ``re`` is only needed in that one method, and keeping it local avoids
      polluting the module namespace given that most other checks don't use it.

Attributes:
    _BREW_MISSING_MSG (str): Standard skip message emitted by the base class
        runner when ``brew`` is not installed. Defined once here to ensure
        consistency across all subclasses if the wording ever needs to change.
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes exported
        to the main runner. Consumed by ``macaudit/main.py`` at startup.

    ``brew doctor`` is Homebrew's canonical self-diagnosis command. It checks

    conflicting ``$PATH`` entries, outdated Homebrew core tap state, invalid
    ``HOMEBREW_*`` environment variables, and other conditions that silently
    break package installs or cause hard-to-diagnose "command not found" errors.

        or the string ``"ready to brew"`` in the combined stdout/stderr output
        indicates health. Any line beginning with ``"Warning:"`` is extracted
        and counted to give an actionable issue count.

class HomebrewMissingCheck(_HomebrewBase):
    """Check for Homebrew formulae whose declared dependencies are not installed.

    When a formula is removed or when Homebrew's dependency graph becomes
    inconsistent (e.g. after a partial uninstall or a tap removal), other
    formulae may be left with missing dependencies. These typically manifest
    as cryptic runtime errors: ``dyld: Library not loaded``, ``library not
    found``, or ``command not found`` for a binary that should be present.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs ``brew missing``. Each line of output names a formula that is
        missing one or more of its declared dependencies. Empty output means
        the dependency graph is consistent.

    Severity scale:
        - ``pass``: No missing dependencies.
        - ``warning``: One or more formulae have missing dependencies. The
          full list is in ``result.data["missing"]``.
        - ``error``: ``brew missing`` exits non-zero with no stdout output
          (indicates a Homebrew internal error, distinct from the case where
          it exits 0 with output listing missing deps).

    Attributes:
        id (str): ``"homebrew_missing"``
        name (str): ``"Homebrew Missing Dependencies"``
        fix_level (str): ``"auto"`` — ``brew missing`` itself identifies the
            broken formulae; individual ``brew install`` or ``brew reinstall``
            commands resolve them.
        fix_command (list[str]): ``["brew", "missing"]``
        fix_reversible (bool): ``False`` — installing missing dependencies is
            additive; no existing files are removed.
        fix_time_estimate (str): Typically under 30 seconds to diagnose; fix
            time depends on what needs to be installed.
