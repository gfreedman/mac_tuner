"""Disk and storage checks for macOS.

This module audits disk space and storage hygiene across eight dimensions:

1. **Free disk space** (``DiskSpaceCheck``) — Queries the boot volume's
   available bytes and grades the result across four severity tiers.

2. **APFS local snapshots** (``APFSSnapshotsCheck``) — Counts Time Machine
   local snapshots stored on the boot disk; reported as informational only,
   because macOS manages snapshot lifecycle automatically.

3. **Xcode DerivedData** (``XcodeDerivedDataCheck``) — Measures the Xcode
   build artifact cache, which can silently grow to 20–50 GB for active
   developers and is always safe to delete.

4. **Container runtime disk usage** (``DockerDiskCheck``) — Measures data
   directories for Docker Desktop, Colima, OrbStack, and Podman.

5. **Trash** (``TrashCheck``) — Reports how much space is consumed by files
   deleted from Finder but not yet permanently removed.

6. **Application caches** (``AppCachesCheck``) — Measures ``~/Library/Caches``,
   which apps grow without bound but which is always safe to clear.

7. **Log files** (``LogFilesCheck``) — Measures ``~/Library/Logs``, where
   app-level diagnostic logs accumulate indefinitely.

8. **iOS device backups** (``iOSBackupsCheck``) — Counts and measures iTunes/
   Finder device backups, which average 5–30 GB each and are never auto-cleaned.

Design decisions:
    - All size measurements use the ``du -sk`` command rather than Python's
      ``os.walk`` + ``os.stat`` approach. ``du`` is faster on APFS (avoids
      redundant ``stat`` calls on millions of inodes), handles sparse files
      correctly, and gracefully reports partial results when it encounters
      permission-denied subdirectories (exit code 1 with partial output).
    - The ``_du`` helper accepts exit code 1 from ``du`` so that measurements
      of user directories (e.g. ``~/Library/Caches``) work even when some
      app-specific subdirectories are protected by SIP or TCC.
    - The ``_df_free_bytes`` helper uses ``df -k`` (1-KB blocks) rather than
      ``df -b`` (bytes) because ``df -b`` is not available on all macOS
      versions.
    - APFS snapshot sizes are approximated via ``/.MobileBackups`` directory
      size, which is the user-visible proxy. The canonical ``tmutil`` approach
      would require iterating snapshots and is much slower.
    - The ``DockerDiskCheck`` also attempts ``docker system df`` (if the
      ``docker`` CLI is on ``$PATH``) for a richer "reclaimable" breakdown,
      but this is supplementary — the primary measurement is always the raw
      data directory size.

Attributes:
    HOME (Path): Resolved home directory of the running process. Used to
        construct all user-scoped paths (``~/Library/...``, ``~/.Trash``, etc.).
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes exported
        to the main runner. Consumed by ``macaudit/main.py`` at startup.

    Shells out to ``du -sk <path>`` (summarise, 1-KB blocks) and multiplies
    the reported value by 1024 to convert to bytes. Accepts ``du`` exit code 1
    because macOS ``du`` exits 1 when it encounters permission-denied
    subdirectories, yet still writes a valid total to stdout for the portions
    it could read.

    Args:
        path (Path): Filesystem path to measure. Must be an absolute path.
            If the path does not exist, 0 is returned immediately without

        - ``0`` — Path does not exist.
        - ``>0`` — Measured size in bytes (rounded to 1 KB by ``du``).

class iOSBackupsCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Check for old iOS/iPadOS device backups consuming disk space.

    iTunes (macOS Catalina and earlier) and Finder (macOS Big Sur and later)
    store full device backups in
    ``~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup``. Each device gets its
    own uniquely named subdirectory. Backups from old phones, loaner devices,
    and factory-reset devices are never automatically deleted and can each
    consume 5–30 GB.

    Detection mechanism:
        Lists subdirectories of the Backup directory (one per device) using
        ``Path.iterdir()``. Measures total backup size with ``_du`` (20-second
        timeout because backup directories can be large and deeply nested).

    Severity scale:
        - ``pass``: Backup directory absent or contains no device subdirectories.
        - ``info``: 1–3 device backups AND total size < 20 GB.
        - ``warning``: > 3 device backups OR total size >= 20 GB.

    Note:
        Reading the Backup directory requires Full Disk Access on macOS
        Ventura and later. If FDA is not granted, a ``PermissionError`` is
        caught and an informational message guides the user to grant access
        via System Settings.

        fix_steps (list[str]): Step-by-step guide using Finder's device
            management UI, plus the manual filesystem path as an alternative.

        fix_time_estimate (str): About 5 minutes to review and delete.
