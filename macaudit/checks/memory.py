"""
Memory and performance checks for Mac Audit.

This module implements four checks that examine RAM utilisation, virtual memory
swap usage, and process-level CPU and memory consumption. Together they help the
user understand why their Mac may feel slow and identify the processes responsible.

Design decisions:
    - Process data is collected once via a single ``ps -eo pid,pcpu,pmem,comm``
      call and parsed by the shared ``_parse_ps()`` helper. Both ``TopCPUCheck``
      and ``TopMemoryCheck`` call ``ps`` independently rather than sharing a
      cache, because each check runs in isolation and the data changes rapidly
      enough that a stale cache would not be useful.
    - Memory pressure is queried via the ``memory_pressure`` CLI tool rather than
      a raw sysctl because the tool encodes Apple's own multi-factor assessment
      (not merely the percentage of RAM in use). The output format is undocumented
      and varies between macOS releases, so the parser uses a two-pass strategy:
      first a structured-line pass, then a colour-word fallback.
    - Swap usage is quantified via ``sysctl vm.swapusage`` rather than inspecting
      the ``/private/var/vm/swapfile*`` files directly. The sysctl gives an
      authoritative summary without requiring elevated privileges.
    - ``_short_name()`` truncates process command paths to 24 characters to keep
      report lines readable. The command value from ``ps`` may be a full absolute
      path (e.g. ``/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari``), so only
      the basename is needed.

Checks:
    - :class:`MemoryPressureCheck` — system memory pressure level (green/yellow/red).
    - :class:`SwapUsageCheck`      — virtual memory swap file usage in GB.
    - :class:`TopCPUCheck`         — top 5 CPU-consuming processes; warn if any ≥90%.
    - :class:`TopMemoryCheck`      — top 5 memory-consuming processes for visibility.

Attributes:
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes exported
        to the scan orchestrator.

Note:
    All subprocess calls use ``self.shell()``, which forces ``LANG=C`` and
    ``LC_ALL=C`` to ensure consistent English-language output regardless of
    the user's system locale setting.

# ── Memory pressure ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class MemoryPressureCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Report macOS memory pressure level (green/yellow/red) via the ``memory_pressure`` CLI.

    macOS computes memory pressure using a multi-factor algorithm that considers
    not just raw RAM utilisation but also the rate of pageouts, compressed memory
    size, swap activity, and wired memory. The result is expressed as one of three
    levels that correspond to traffic-light colours:

    - **Green (Normal)**: RAM is ample; no paging pressure.
    - **Yellow (Warning)**: Memory is being actively managed; performance may
      degrade under additional load. The Compressed Memory system is working hard.
    - **Red (Critical)**: The system is swapping heavily to disk. App launch times
      increase dramatically; the system may feel unresponsive.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs the ``memory_pressure`` command-line tool, which is provided by macOS
        and reports the same level shown in Activity Monitor's Memory Pressure graph.
        The output format has changed across macOS versions, so the parser uses a
        two-pass approach: a structured ``"System memory pressure level: …"`` line
        is checked first, then a fallback scans for raw colour words
        (``"red"``, ``"yellow"``, ``"green"``).

        at ``/usr/bin/memory_pressure`` on all supported macOS versions.

        Parsing strategy:
            1. First pass — structured line detection: scans each line for the
               prefix ``"system memory pressure"`` and then classifies the trailing
               word as ``"critical"``, ``"warn"``, or ``"normal"``. This matches

            2. Second pass (fallback) — colour word detection: if no structured line
               is found, searches the full output for the raw colour words
               ``"red"``, ``"yellow"``, or ``"green"``. This catches the simplified
               output format seen on macOS Sequoia (15+) and any future format

# ── Swap usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class SwapUsageCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Check virtual memory swap usage via ``sysctl vm.swapusage``.

    Virtual memory swap allows the OS to move portions of RAM contents to disk
    when physical RAM is exhausted. On macOS, swap files are stored in
    ``/private/var/vm/`` and are encrypted at rest. While swap enables the
    system to continue running under memory pressure, it is significantly slower
    than physical RAM — even on fast NVMe SSDs — and heavy swap usage adds wear
    cycles to the SSD.

    Apple Silicon vs Intel:
        Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture (SoC-integrated DRAM) handles
        swap somewhat more gracefully than Intel Macs because the memory bandwidth
        is higher and the swap target is always the internal NVMe. However, the
        fundamental performance penalty still applies, and the SSD wear concern is
        the same.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs ``sysctl -n vm.swapusage`` and parses the ``used = N.NN M/G`` field
        using a regular expression. The unit (M for MiB, G for GiB) is captured
        and used to convert the value to GiB for threshold comparison.

    Severity thresholds (chosen empirically):
        - ``pass`` — less than 1 GB swap used. Minimal, incidental usage.
        - ``info`` — 1–3.9 GB used. Moderate; typical for power users with many
          large apps open.
        - ``warning`` — 4–7.9 GB used. Heavy swap; performance is meaningfully
          degraded.
        - ``critical`` — 8+ GB used. The system is severely swap-bound; closing
          applications or restarting is strongly recommended.

        id (str): ``"swap_usage"`` — stable machine-readable identifier.

class TopCPUCheck(BaseCheck):
    """List the top 5 CPU-consuming processes and flag any above 90%.

    A process that consumes 90% or more of CPU continuously is almost certainly
    misbehaving — typical user-facing apps do not sustain near-maximum CPU usage
    for more than a few seconds. Sustained high CPU causes thermal throttling,
    battery drain, and stolen resources from the apps the user is actually using.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs ``ps -eo pid,pcpu,pmem,comm`` to snapshot all running processes with
        their CPU percentage, memory percentage, and command name. The output is
        parsed by the shared ``_parse_ps()`` helper, sorted by CPU percentage
        descending, and the top 5 are selected. The top process's CPU usage
        determines the result status.

    ps field glossary:
        - ``pid``:  Process ID.
        - ``pcpu``: Instantaneous CPU usage percentage (0–100 per core).
        - ``pmem``: Resident set size as a percentage of total physical RAM.

        - ``warning`` — the highest-CPU process is at 90% or more.
        - ``pass``    — all processes are below 90% CPU.

    Why 90%:
        On modern multi-core Macs, a single process consuming exactly 100% of one
        core is normal (e.g. a compilation job). However, when ``pcpu`` approaches
        or exceeds 90% it often means the process is spinning in a tight loop due
        to a bug or runaway state. 90% was chosen over 100% because macOS reports
        ``pcpu`` as a rolling average that rarely reaches the theoretical maximum.

# ── Top memory consumers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class TopMemoryCheck(BaseCheck):
    """List the top 5 memory-consuming processes for visibility into RAM usage.

    Unlike :class:`TopCPUCheck`, this check is purely informational — it does not
    produce a ``warning`` or ``critical`` result regardless of the values it
    finds. Its purpose is to give the user context for explaining high memory
    pressure or swap usage, not to flag a specific threshold.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs ``ps -eo pid,pcpu,pmem,comm``, parses output via ``_parse_ps()``,
        sorts by ``pmem`` (memory percentage) descending, and reports the top 3
        in the result message.

    Why informational only:
        Memory usage percentages from ``ps`` (``pmem``) represent the Resident Set
        Size (RSS) as a fraction of total physical RAM and do not account for
        compressed memory, shared pages, or the GPU allocation pool. Setting hard
        thresholds on ``pmem`` would produce noisy false positives (e.g. a Chrome
        renderer at 8% on a 16 GB Mac is completely normal). The meaningful
        threshold for action is already surfaced by :class:`MemoryPressureCheck`.

    Attributes:

        Calls ``ps`` with a 10-second timeout as a safety net. The output is

        ``mem`` (pmem percentage) descending, and a compact summary string of
        the top 3 is included in the result message.

    The ``ps`` output begins with a header line (``PID %CPU %MEM COMM``) that
    is unconditionally skipped by slicing ``output.splitlines()[1:]``. Each
    remaining line is split on whitespace with a maximum of 3 splits
    (``split(None, 3)``) to correctly handle command names that contain spaces
    (e.g. ``"Google Chrome Helper (Renderer)"``). Lines with fewer than 4 fields
    are silently skipped.

    Args:
        output (str): Raw standard output from the command
            ``ps -eo pid,pcpu,pmem,comm``.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: A list of process dictionaries. Each dict has the following
        keys:

        - ``"pid"`` (int): Process ID.
        - ``"cpu"`` (float): CPU usage as a percentage (0.0–100.0 per core).

        - ``"comm"`` (str): Full command path as reported by ``ps``
          (may be absolute path or relative name depending on the process).

        Lines that fail integer/float conversion (malformed ps output) are
        silently skipped.

    Note:
        ``pcpu`` in ``ps`` is not a real-time reading; it is a rolling exponential
        moving average of CPU utilisation since the process started. For long-lived
        processes (hours or days), this may understate a *recent* spike in CPU
        usage.

    For display in the compact result message, only the final path component
