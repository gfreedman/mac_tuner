"""
Hardware health checks for Mac Audit.

This module implements four hardware-level diagnostic checks that evaluate the
physical health and operating state of the Mac. Each check is implemented as a
subclass of :class:`~macaudit.checks.base.BaseCheck` and exposes its findings
as a :class:`~macaudit.checks.base.CheckResult`.

Design decisions:
    - ``_get_power_data()`` is decorated with ``@lru_cache(maxsize=1)`` so that
      ``system_profiler SPPowerDataType`` (which takes ~1–3 s to run) is invoked
      exactly once per process even though both ``BatteryCheck`` and future
      power-related checks may call it.
    - SMART status is queried via ``diskutil info /`` rather than ``diskutil info
      disk0`` to correctly handle external boot drives, Fusion Drives, and APFS
      volume configurations where the boot volume might not be on disk0.
    - Kernel panic files are located in ``/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`` (the
      system-wide panic log directory). Panics in the user's own
      ``~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`` are *not* counted because they
      represent application crashes, not kernel-level failures.
    - Thermal throttling is detected through two complementary mechanisms:
      ``pmset -g thermlog`` (universal) and ``sysctl machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level``
      (Intel/XCPM-only). The sysctl key does not exist on Apple Silicon.

Checks:
    - :class:`BatteryCheck`      — cycle count, condition, maximum capacity.
    - :class:`SMARTStatusCheck`  — disk SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
                                   Reporting Technology) health status.
    - :class:`KernelPanicCheck`  — count of kernel panic reports in the past 7 days.
    - :class:`ThermalCheck`      — CPU thermal throttling state.

Attributes:
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes exported
        to the scan orchestrator. The orchestrator instantiates each class and
        calls ``execute()`` to obtain a :class:`CheckResult`.

Note:
    All subprocess calls use ``self.shell()``, which forces ``LANG=C`` and
    ``LC_ALL=C`` so that tool output is always in English regardless of the
    system locale. This is essential for reliable string matching.

    """Invoke ``system_profiler SPPowerDataType`` once and cache the result.

    ``system_profiler SPPowerDataType`` outputs detailed power and battery
    information in a human-readable property-list style text format. The call
    typically takes 1–3 seconds because the tool enumerates hardware via IOKit.
    The ``@lru_cache`` decorator ensures this cost is paid only once per
    process lifetime even when multiple checks request the same data.

# ── Battery ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class BatteryCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Check battery cycle count, maximum capacity, and Apple's condition rating.

    This check parses the output of ``system_profiler SPPowerDataType`` to
    extract three key battery health metrics:

    1. **Cycle count**: The number of complete charge cycles the battery has
       completed. Apple rates Mac batteries for approximately 1,000 cycles.
       Beyond that, maximum capacity degrades noticeably.
    2. **Maximum capacity**: The percentage of the battery's original design
       capacity still available. A new battery is typically 100%; anything
       below 80% indicates meaningful degradation.
    3. **Condition**: Apple's own assessment of battery health. The possible
       values are ``"Normal"``, ``"Service Recommended"``, ``"Replace Soon"``,
       and ``"Replace Now"``. Anything other than ``"Normal"`` warrants action.

    Detection mechanism:
        Calls ``_get_power_data()`` to obtain cached ``system_profiler
        SPPowerDataType`` output, then parses it line-by-line using string
        containment checks and ``re.search()`` for numeric extraction.

    Severity thresholds:
        - ``critical`` — condition is ``"Service Recommended"``, ``"Replace Now"``,
          or ``"Replace Soon"``. These indicate Apple's hardware diagnostics have
          flagged the battery as degraded.
        - ``warning`` — ``max_capacity < 80%`` even if condition is ``"Normal"``.
          This threshold (80%) is the same value Apple uses in System Settings to
          display the "Battery health: XX%" bar and trigger the "Service Recommended"
          state in newer macOS versions.
        - ``info`` — battery present and healthy, or this is a desktop Mac.

# ── SMART status ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class SMARTStatusCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Check SMART disk health status on the boot volume.

    Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) is a standard
    built into most modern hard drives and SSDs. The drive firmware continuously
    monitors internal health metrics — reallocated sectors, read error rates,
    uncorrectable errors, spin retries, etc. — and aggregates them into a single
    pass/fail status that the OS can query.

    This check queries the SMART status of the boot volume (the volume mounted at
    ``/``) via ``diskutil info /``. Using ``/`` rather than a device path such as
    ``disk0`` makes the check portable across single-drive setups, external boot
    drives, Fusion Drive configurations, and APFS volume groups.

    Detection mechanism:
        Runs ``diskutil info /`` and scans its output for the ``SMART Status:``
        line. The value after the colon is then classified into one of three
        outcomes: passing (``"Verified"``), failing (any value containing
        ``"fail"``), or informational (``"Not Supported"``, unknown values).

    Apple Silicon note:
        On Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and later), the NVMe controller is proprietary
        and does not expose the standard SMART protocol. ``diskutil`` will report
        ``"Not Supported"`` for such drives. This is expected and should not be
        treated as a warning. The check uses the ``IS_APPLE_SILICON`` flag from
        :mod:`macaudit.system_info` to suppress the warning on these platforms.

# ── Kernel panics ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class KernelPanicCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Count kernel panic reports from the last 7 days.

    A kernel panic is the macOS equivalent of a Windows BSOD: the operating
    system kernel detects an unrecoverable error — typically bad memory, a
    faulty kernel extension (kext), a GPU driver bug, or a hardware I/O error
    — and immediately halts to prevent data corruption.

    macOS writes a diagnostic report for each panic to
    ``/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports``. These report files contain the panic
    backtrace, loaded kernel extensions, and hardware identifiers, and their
    filenames contain the word ``"Panic"``.

    Detection mechanism:
        This check scans the ``/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`` directory for
        files whose names contain ``"Panic"`` or ``"panic"`` and whose
        modification time (``mtime``) falls within the last 7 days. It does
        *not* parse file contents — the filename and recency are sufficient to
        establish the count.

    Why 7 days:
        A single isolated kernel panic over several months is not unusual and
        may be caused by a transient hardware condition (e.g. a brief power
        fluctuation). The 7-day window focuses attention on *recent* patterns
        that suggest an active, unresolved problem.

    Severity thresholds:
        - ``pass`` — zero panics in the last 7 days.
        - ``warning`` — 1 or 2 panics. Possibly transient; worth noting.
        - ``critical`` — 3 or more panics. A pattern that requires investigation.

    Full Disk Access note:
        Reading ``/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`` requires Full Disk Access
        (FDA) permission in macOS Ventura and later when running in a sandboxed
        context. If FDA is not granted, the check catches the resulting
        ``PermissionError`` and returns an ``info`` result rather than
        incorrectly reporting zero panics.

        The check uses the filesystem ``mtime`` of each diagnostic report file as
        a proxy for when the panic occurred. This avoids parsing the (large,
        complex) panic report format and is sufficiently accurate for a 7-day
        recency filter.

        Files are filtered by name (must contain ``"Panic"`` or ``"panic"``) and
        then by ``mtime >= now - 7 days``. Individual ``OSError`` exceptions when
        stat-ing a specific file are silently skipped to handle race conditions
        (e.g. a file deleted between ``listdir`` and ``getmtime``).

# ── Thermal throttling ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class ThermalCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Detect active CPU thermal throttling via pmset and sysctl.

    When a Mac's CPU or GPU generates more heat than the cooling system can
    dissipate, macOS's power management subsystem (``pmset``) automatically
    reduces CPU and GPU clock speeds to lower heat output. This is called
    thermal throttling. While it prevents hardware damage, it can reduce
    effective CPU performance by 30–50% and makes the Mac feel sluggish under
    load.

    Common causes of thermal throttling:
        - Blocked ventilation ports (laptop placed on a soft surface or lap).
        - Demanding workloads run continuously (ML training, video encoding).
        - Dust accumulation in vents or on heatsink fins.
        - A failing or disconnected fan.
        - Ambient temperature above the operating specification (10–35°C).

    Detection mechanism:
        Two complementary sources are queried:

        1. ``pmset -g thermlog`` — available on all Macs. The output includes
           a ``CPU_Speed_Limit`` field (0–100%) and a ``Thermal_Pressure`` field.
           ``CPU_Speed_Limit < 100`` or any thermal pressure event other than
           ``"No Thermal Pressure"`` indicates active throttling.

        2. ``sysctl -n machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level`` — Intel/XCPM-only.
           The ``machdep.xcpm.*`` namespace belongs to the Intel eXtended CPU
           Power Management subsystem (XCPM) and does not exist on Apple Silicon.
           A non-zero value indicates the XCPM kernel driver is applying thermal
           limits.

    Apple Silicon note:
        On M-series Macs the sysctl key ``machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level`` does
        not exist. The check guards against this with ``IS_APPLE_SILICON`` and
        only queries the sysctl on Intel hosts.

        id (str): ``"thermal_state"`` — stable machine-readable identifier.
        name (str): ``"CPU Thermal State"`` — display name in the report.

        The method first parses ``pmset -g thermlog`` output, looking for two
        distinct signal patterns:

        - ``CPU_Speed_Limit = N``: A value below 100 means the CPU is running at
          reduced speed. The ``pmset`` tool normalises this as a percentage of
          the maximum rated clock speed.
        - Thermal pressure keywords: The presence of ``"Thermal Pressure"``
          without the preceding ``"No"`` indicates an active throttle event.

        If no throttling is detected from ``pmset`` and the host is Intel, the
        check additionally queries ``sysctl -n machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level``.
        A non-zero integer from this sysctl means XCPM has applied hardware-
        level thermal limits.

        Returns:
            CheckResult: A result with one of the following statuses:

            - ``"info"`` — pmset output unavailable.
            - ``"pass"`` — no thermal throttling detected by either source.
            - ``"warning"`` — active thermal throttling detected; performance
              is being reduced to manage heat.

        Note:
            The ``sysctl machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level`` key is only available
            on Intel Macs running the XCPM power management stack. It is absent
            on Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs. This check guards against running
