"""
Network exposure and sharing-service checks.

This module implements 10 checks that audit the network-facing attack surface
of the Mac, covering wireless discoverability, active sharing services, DNS
configuration, proxy settings, listening ports, and Bluetooth exposure.

Design decisions:
    - All service-detection checks (SSH, Screen Sharing, File Sharing, Internet
      Sharing) use ``launchctl list <service-name>`` as the primary probe.
      This is more reliable than reading plist files directly because launchctl
      reflects the *live* kernel service state, not just the stored preference.
      Plist files are read as a fallback when launchctl is unavailable (e.g.
      when macaudit runs in a non-standard user context).
    - The DNS check targets only **public IPv4** addresses not in the
      known-safe set.  Private RFC-1918 ranges (10.x, 192.168.x, 172.16–31.x)
      and IPv6 addresses are unconditionally excluded; DHCP-assigned local
      resolvers are nearly always benign.
    - The Proxy check detects the default network interface via ``route get
      default`` rather than hardcoding ``en0`` or ``en1``, which handles Macs
      using Ethernet (en2, en3) or Thunderbolt adapters as the primary interface.
    - The listening-ports check uses ``lsof`` rather than ``netstat`` because
      ``lsof -i`` reports the process name alongside each port, allowing the
      display to show "TCP:12345 (processname)" rather than a raw port number.
    - Loopback-only listeners (127.0.0.1, ::1) are excluded from the
      ListeningPortsCheck because they are not reachable from the network and
      never represent an external exposure.

Checks:
    - :class:`AirDropCheck`          — AirDrop discoverability setting.
    - :class:`RemoteLoginCheck`      — SSH remote login service state.
    - :class:`ScreenSharingCheck`    — Screen Sharing (VNC) service state.
    - :class:`FileSharingCheck`      — SMB / AFP file sharing service state.
    - :class:`InternetSharingCheck`  — NAT hotspot / Internet Sharing state.
    - :class:`DNSCheck`              — Custom or suspicious DNS nameservers.
    - :class:`ProxyCheck`            — Active HTTP / HTTPS proxy detection.
    - :class:`SavedWifiCheck`        — Count of saved Wi-Fi networks.
    - :class:`BluetoothCheck`        — Bluetooth power state and discoverability.
    - :class:`ListeningPortsCheck`   — TCP and UDP listening port enumeration.

Attributes:
    _KNOWN_GOOD_DNS (set[str]): IPv4 addresses of well-known, trustworthy
        public DNS resolvers.  Addresses in this set do not trigger the
        DNSCheck warning even if they are not in a private range.
    _PRIVATE_PREFIXES (tuple[str, ...]): Tuple of address prefixes that
        identify RFC-1918 private network ranges and loopback.  Used by
        DNSCheck to unconditionally skip private-range DNS addresses.
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes
        exported to the scan orchestrator.

Note:
    All subprocess calls use ``self.shell()``, which enforces ``LANG=C``
    and ``LC_ALL=C`` to guarantee English-language output for string
    matching regardless of the user's system locale.
