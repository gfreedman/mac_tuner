"""Security hardening checks for macOS.

This module implements fifteen security checks covering the most impactful
configuration surfaces on a macOS system. Checks are grouped thematically:

**Authentication & access control**
    - ``AutoLoginCheck`` — Detects if the login screen is bypassed entirely.
    - ``GuestAccountCheck`` — Detects if the Guest account is enabled.
    - ``SSHAuthorizedKeysCheck`` — Audits passwordless SSH access grants.
    - ``SSHKeyStrengthCheck`` — Flags broken (DSA) and weak SSH key types.
    - ``SSHConfigCheck`` — Detects risky sshd settings (password auth, root login).

**Persistence mechanisms**
    - ``LaunchAgentsCheck`` — Scans launch agent/daemon directories for
      non-Apple and structurally suspicious entries.
    - ``LoginHooksCheck`` — Detects legacy login/logout hooks that run
      arbitrary scripts as root.
    - ``CronJobsCheck`` — Detects user cron jobs, a classic malware persistence
      mechanism.

**Network & traffic**
    - ``EtcHostsCheck`` — Scans ``/etc/hosts`` for rogue DNS-redirect entries.
    - ``SharingServicesCheck`` — Enumerates active network-listening services
      (SSH, Screen Sharing, SMB).

**Device security**
    - ``ActivationLockCheck`` — Verifies Find My / Activation Lock is configured.

**System integrity**
    - ``MDMProfilesCheck`` — Detects configuration profiles that could alter
      DNS, inject certificates, or modify security policies.
    - ``SystemRootCACheck`` — Audits the System keychain for unexpected root
      certificates and known traffic-inspection tool certificates.
    - ``SystemExtensionsCheck`` — Lists active kernel-adjacent system extensions.
    - ``XProtectCheck`` — Verifies XProtect malware signatures are recent.

Design decisions:
    - All checks use ``self.shell(...)`` (the base class shell wrapper) rather
      than direct ``subprocess`` calls. This keeps shell invocations testable
      and consistently handles timeout, capture, and error propagation.
    - The ``defaults read`` approach for login settings (AutoLogin, GuestEnabled,
      LoginHook) is preferred over reading plist files directly because
      ``defaults`` resolves the active value accounting for managed preferences
      and caching layers.
    - Launch agent scanning uses filename prefix heuristics (``com.apple.*``)
      rather than signature verification because the goal is user awareness,
      not forensic attribution.
    - ``SharingServicesCheck`` uses ``launchctl list`` rather than ``lsof`` or
      ``netstat`` because it gives a definitive "is this service registered?"
      answer without requiring elevated privileges.

Attributes:
    HOME (Path): Resolved home directory of the running process.
    _STANDARD_HOSTS (frozenset[str] | set[str]): Set of hostnames that are
        normal in any ``/etc/hosts`` file and should not be flagged.
    _LOOPBACK_PREFIXES (tuple[str, ...]): IP address prefixes that indicate
        a loopback or reserved address. Entries with these IPs are always
        skipped during ``/etc/hosts`` analysis.
    _LAUNCH_AGENT_DIRS (list[Path]): Ordered list of directories scanned for
        ``.plist`` persistence entries. Ordered user-level first, then system-
        level.
    _SSH_DIR (Path): Path to the current user's ``.ssh`` directory.
    _AUTHORIZED_KEYS (Path): Full path to the current user's
        ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
    ALL_CHECKS (list[type[BaseCheck]]): Ordered list of check classes exported
        to the main runner.

class AutoLoginCheck(BaseCheck):
    """Detect if macOS auto-login is enabled, bypassing the login screen entirely.

    Auto-login causes macOS to log into a specific user account automatically
    on boot, without presenting a password prompt. This is a catastrophic
    physical security failure: anyone who powers on or restarts a Mac with
    auto-login enabled gets immediate, unencumbered access to the entire user
    account — files, browser sessions, saved passwords, and connected cloud
    services.

    Detection mechanism:
        Reads the ``autoLoginUser`` key from
        ``/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow`` using the ``defaults``
        command. A non-zero exit code from ``defaults read`` means the key does
        not exist, which is the normal (safe) state.

    Severity scale:
        - ``pass``: ``autoLoginUser`` key is absent (auto-login disabled).
        - ``critical``: Key is present and has a non-empty value (a specific
          username is configured for auto-login).
