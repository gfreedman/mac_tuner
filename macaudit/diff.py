"""
Scan diffing — compare two scan payloads and return structured changes.

This module implements **pure diffing logic** with no I/O or side-effects.
It consumes two JSON-shaped dicts (in the same schema as ``--json`` output)
and produces a diff dict describing what changed between them.

Diff categories:
    ``improved``
        Checks whose severity *decreased* (e.g. ``critical`` → ``pass``).
    ``regressed``
        Checks whose severity *increased* (e.g. ``pass`` → ``critical``).
    ``new_checks``
        Checks present in *current* but absent in *previous*
        (e.g. a new macaudit version added a check).
    ``removed_checks``
        Checks present in *previous* but absent in *current*
        (e.g. a check was removed or excluded via ``--skip``).

Filter-mismatch suppression:
    When the user runs two scans with different ``--only`` / ``--skip``
    flags, many checks will appear as added or removed even though no
    real change occurred.  If more than 50% of checks are in the
    ``new_checks`` or ``removed_checks`` buckets, those buckets are
    cleared to avoid misleading noise in the diff panel.

Attributes:
    _STATUS_SEVERITY (dict[str, int]): Maps each status string to an
        integer severity rank used to determine improvement vs regression.
        Higher values are more severe.

Note:
    All functions in this module are stateless and side-effect-free.
    They may be called freely from tests without any setup.

from macaudit.enums import CheckStatus


# ── Status severity ranking ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Maps each check status to an integer rank.  A decrease in rank
# (curr_sev < prev_sev) means the check improved; an increase means
# it regressed.  ``pass`` is the best state (0); ``critical`` is worst (5).
# Keys are CheckStatus members; because CheckStatus inherits from str, plain
# string lookups (e.g. from JSON payloads) work without conversion.

_STATUS_SEVERITY: dict[CheckStatus, int] = {
    CheckStatus.PASS:     0,
    CheckStatus.INFO:     1,
    CheckStatus.SKIP:     2,

def compute_diff(current: dict, previous: dict) -> dict | None:
    """Compare two scan payloads and return a structured diff dict.

    The two payloads must share the same ``schema_version``; diffing
    across incompatible schemas would produce meaningless results.  Both
    dicts must follow the JSON output schema (see ``_output_json`` in
    ``main.py`` for the canonical shape).

    The function returns ``None`` rather than an empty diff dict when there
    are no meaningful changes, allowing callers to skip the diff panel
    entirely.

    Args:
        current (dict): The payload produced by the just-completed scan.
            Must contain ``schema_version``, ``score``, and ``results``
            keys in the standard JSON output format.
        previous (dict): The most recent historical payload loaded from
            ``~/.config/macaudit/history/``.  Must share the same
            ``schema_version`` as *current*.

    Returns:
        Optional[dict]: A diff dict with the following keys on success::

            {
                "previous_scan_time": str,   # ISO-8601 timestamp
                "score_before":       int,   # health score of previous scan
                "score_after":        int,   # health score of current scan
                "score_delta":        int,   # score_after - score_before
                "improved":           list,  # checks that got better
                "regressed":          list,  # checks that got worse
                "new_checks":         list,  # checks only in current
                "removed_checks":     list,  # checks only in previous
            }

        Returns ``None`` if:
          - ``schema_version`` differs between the two payloads, OR
          - The diff contains no meaningful changes (score unchanged,
            no improved/regressed/new/removed checks).

    Note:
        Each entry in ``improved``, ``regressed``, ``new_checks``, and
        ``removed_checks`` is a dict with keys ``id``, ``name``,
        ``category``, ``status``, and ``message``.
