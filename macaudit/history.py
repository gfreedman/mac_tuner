"""
Scan history — persist full scan snapshots for inter-scan diffing.

Each completed scan is serialised to a JSON file under
``~/.config/macaudit/history/`` using a UTC ISO-8601 timestamp as the
filename.  The directory is created on first write and is capped at
``_MAX_SCANS`` files; older files are pruned automatically after each save.

JSON schema (``schema_version: 1``)::

    {
        "schema_version": 1,
        "macaudit_version": "1.12.0",
        "scan_time": "2025-04-04T12:00:00+00:00",
        "system": {
            "macos_version": "15.3.1",
            "architecture": "Apple Silicon",
            "model": "MacBook Pro (M3 Max)"
        },
        "score": 87,
        "summary": {"pass": 52, "warning": 4, "critical": 1, ...},
        "results": [ ... ]   // serialised CheckResult dataclasses
    }

Design decisions:
    - The payload shape intentionally mirrors the ``--json`` CLI output so
      that external tools consuming ``--json`` can also parse history files.
    - All I/O operations are wrapped in ``try/except OSError`` so a history
      write failure never crashes a scan.
    - ``_build_payload()`` is module-private but also imported directly by
      ``main.py`` for diff computation (to avoid building the payload twice).

Attributes:
    _HISTORY_DIR (pathlib.Path): Filesystem path to the history directory.
    _MAX_SCANS (int): Maximum number of scan snapshots to retain.
        Older files beyond this cap are deleted by ``prune_history()``.
